\chapter*{Abstract}
This thesis presents an advanced imaging solution for Operating System
Multiplication over the network based on UDP Cast with a suite of added
software. It presents the idea for a centralized archiving system and
distribution of the images over the network along with the deployment
of the solution.

The fist chapters present the features of UDP Cast, an open source project
for multicast transmission of data, along with the shortcomings of
UDP Cast.

The proposed project in the thesis focuses on implementing a system that
fixes the discovered problems. The idea presented is an architecture with
an Imaging Client and an Imaging Server.

The last chapters present the implementation of the Client and the Server,
ending with the evaluation on the model.
