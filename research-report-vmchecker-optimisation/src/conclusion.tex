The VMchecker is a very usefull tool for both students an teachers and is a
good framework to build uppon. Continuing its development to provide better
services to its users is both possible and could bring semnificant results
with rather small tweeks.

The next step is the implement the proposed improvements to VMchecker in
the open source project. Simulations of the new algorithm based on the
existing data of submissions could provided the expected results of the
implementation, but the real results can only be observed after
implementing the optimizations and monitoring the performance of the new
system.
